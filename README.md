## Hotel-Management

#### Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write JavaFX code with Maven in Visual Studio Code.

#### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src\java`: the folder to maintain source java files
- `src\resources`: the folder to maintain java fxml files

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `target` folder by default.

#### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies.
